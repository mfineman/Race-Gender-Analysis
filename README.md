## Race and Gender in the Workforce 

# Project Overview

American companies have been engaged in equal opportunity and diversity efforts since the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.  The purpose of this project was to expore available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see how women and racial/ethnic minorities are faring 55 years later.  I was particularly interested in the status of these groups in higher level jobs, defined for the purpose as professionals, managers, and chief executives, and in their progress over the period between 2010 and 2019 (the latest year for which BLS had data.  This was a decade in which many companies' diversity efforts were seen to mature and in which many made considerable investments. I also proposed to project whatever trends I found into the future in order to estimate where workforce diversity might be expected to stand ten years hence.
